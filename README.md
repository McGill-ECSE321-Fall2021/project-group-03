The team should provide a welcome page that introduces the team and describes the main scope of the project in 
the README.md file in the root of each teamâ€™s repository. In addition, the README.md file should contain an 
overview table with names, team roles, and individual efforts (in hours) with separated entries for each deliverable.

Welcome to group 3's github repository!

Allow us to introduce ourselves! 
Our team members are: Adam Geenen, Tara Ginsberg, Abraham Somech, Liam Serour and Samuel-Ryan Vasserman.
We are all second year students at McGill and are very happy to finally be studying in person!
We actually worked in a group together last semester when it was all virtual and are looking forward to 
working on this project together in person. 

The main scope of this project is to, as a team, create a library management system with the following functionality. The
library management system will be made up of users, librarians, head-librarians as well as different titles (books, music albums,
newspapers and movies). In addition, the library will have study rooms and party rooms that can be reserved for events. Our library
management system will allow for users to create accounts, use the library systems and manage all the different schedules (library, staff 
and room schedules). Finally, the most important parts of the system should be accesible via a web frontend and a mobile android application.
